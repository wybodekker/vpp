vpp is a Bash script that displays a PDF or PostScript document (after
conversion to PDF). The user can use the viewer to print the document or,
alternatively, leave the viewer and use vppâ€™s facilities to print selected
pages to a one- or two-sided hardcopy or an A5-booklet: see the section
/Page selection and other commands/ for the details. Instead of printing your
selections, you can also save them into PDF files.
